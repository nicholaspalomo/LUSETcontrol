# LUSET Control and Collision Detection ROS C++/Gazebo Project

> This is the ROS implementation in C++ with a Gazebo simulation for the software-side of LUSET project at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. This project replaces the original control system, which was programmed in MATLAB.

> For more information on the LUSET project, go to https://kaufmann.ibk.ethz.ch/research/LUSET.html. Also check out this informational video (in German) featuring Professor Walter Kaufmann, head of the Structural Engineering Institute (IBK) at ETH, explaining the LUSET project: https://vimeo.com/355932476.

<!-- ## Example (Launching simulation) -->

<!-- ```javascript
// code away!

let generateProject = project => {
  let code = [];
  for (let js = 0; js < project.length; js++) {
    code.push(js);
  }
};
``` -->
---

## Installation

- The code has only been tested in ROS Melodic running on Ubuntu 18.04 (Linux recommended, but may work with WSL - see https://jack-kawell.com/2019/06/24/setting-up-a-ros-development-environment-in-windows/ and https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/3368 for more information).
- Follow the guide at http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Ubuntu and complete the installation of ROS Melodic on your system.

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using 
- Install Eigen by entering the following in a terminal:
```
~/LUSETcontrol
git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
```

### Setup

- To run the simulation with dummy inputs, open a new terminal and navigate to the catkin workspace where this repo has been cloned.
```
cd ~/LUSETcontrol
```
- Build and launch the project.
```
catkin_make
roslaunch indel_update_pkg indel_update_pkg.launch
```
The Gazebo simulation will open in a new window. In the toolbar at the top, you can select `Edit > Reset World` to reset the simulation.

- Open a new terminal and type
```
cd ~/LUSETcontrol
source devel/setup.bash
rostopic echo /LusetContacts
```
to get print statements to the terminal every time a collision occurs between two or more components.

---

## Features

### Tested and working features

- Run a Gazebo simulation with actuator inputs supplied by the `/IndelUpdate` rostopic. These messages are routed to the `/LusetControl` node via the `/LusetState` node.
- Use `rqt_graph` to visualize the network or ros topics, subscriptions, publications, and nodes.

### Pending features

- Implementation of unit and integration tests
- Investigating Rviz support
- Troubleshooting the multithreaded ROS subscriptions, particularly in the `luset_control_pkg_node`
- Add custom plots in `rqt_plot` for visualizing (graphically) the messages being passed between the nodes

## Usage

## Documentation

All of the code is documented. You can find the Doxygen documentation in the `~/LUSETcontrol/doxygen` folder (C++ only). For more information about Doxygen, visit http://www.doxygen.nl/.

## FAQ

- **How do I debug this project?**
  - ROS logging
    - You can always place `ROS_INFO()`, `ROS_DEBUG()`, and `ROS_ERROR()` statements throughout the C++ code.
    - These functions have the same signature as `printf()`
    - They will appear in the ROS log files for the nodes in which they have been placed as soon as you shut down the `roscore`. The log files are stored at `~/.ros/log`.
  - GDB
    - I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code for code development and debugging. For more information, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/.
    - To get started with debugging in GDB, open the repo in Visual Studio Code
    - Open `.vscode/tasks.json` in the root of your workspace.
    - Add a new task:
```json
  {
      "label": "ROS: catkin_make",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "catkin_make",
      "args": [
          "-j4",
          "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"
      ],
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "group": {
          "kind": "build",
          "isDefault": true
      }
  }
```
    - Save and close `tasks.json`. In the same directory, open `launch.json`.
    - Add the following block:
```json
  {
      "name": "(gdb) Launch",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/devel/lib/luset_control_pkg/luset_control_pkg_node",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
          {
              "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
              "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
              "ignoreFailures": true
          }
      ]
  }
```
    - You can replace the value of the `"program"` tag to that of another node executable, e.g. `"${workspaceFolder}/devel/lib/luset_state_pkg/luset_state_pkg_node"`, etc., in order to debug that node instead.
    - To begin debugging the node, place a breakpoint in the source code of the node.
    - Open the debugging tab on the left-hand side of the VS Code editor, select `(gdb) Launch` from the dropdown menu and click `Run` to start debugging the code. The call stack will be executed up until the breakpoint at which point execution is paused.

- **I want to change the valve configuration that is loaded to the parameter server. How do I load my new YAML file?**

    - Change line 9 of `luset_control_pkg.launch` to match the name and path of your new YAML file.
