Class \hyperlink{classlusetcontrolnamespace_1_1LusetControl}{lusetcontrolnamespace\+:\+:Luset\+Control} ]This class is responsible for computing control actions as axis/valve displacements and for passing them to the Indel\+Update node. This class has not yet been implemented. Several things must be included in this or other class definitions, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The A matrix needs to be specified somewhere -\/ probably as arrays on the parameter server (i.\+e. in a Y\+A\+ML file)
\item Need to also specify the relationships between the information coming from L\+U\+S\+ET State and the control variable definitons. From the current values of the control variables, use the A-\/matrix to compute the current actuator displacements
\item Have a C\+Make flag that only includes the proper header corresponding to the test the user wishes to run such that the correct parameters are loaded to the R\+OS parameter server at runtime
\item Use some sort of optimization to generate a trajectory; if you can\textquotesingle{}t finish this, have it generate linear trajectories as interpolations and have it pause issuing new commands if certain control variables are lagging
\item Somewhere the location and orientation of the C\+OM of the yokes should be computed and published.
